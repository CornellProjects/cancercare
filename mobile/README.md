<h3>Libraries and packages</h3>
<p>To implement this app, several libraries and packages were used.</p>

<p> NativeBase is used to implement pages. NativeBase is a free and open source UI component library for React Native to build native mobile apps for iOS and Android platforms. You can easily set up new pages by using NativeBase.</p>

<h4>2. Redux</h4>
<p>Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps based on flux, which is the application architecture that Facebook uses for building client-side web applications. The concept behind flux is similar to MVC. By using redux, you can build your app background service.</p>
